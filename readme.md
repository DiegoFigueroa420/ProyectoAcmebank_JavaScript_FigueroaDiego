## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Design Pattern**: Traditional multi-page application (MPA)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern design principles and responsive layout
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ classes and modules for code organization

### Backend Architecture
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for data persistence
- **Authentication**: Client-side validation with simulated session management
- **State Management**: JavaScript class-based state management

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Data Structure**: JSON objects stored as strings
- **Collections**: 
  - `bankUsers`: User profiles and credentials
  - `bankAccounts`: Account information and balances
  - `bankTransactions`: Transaction history

## Key Components

### 1. Authentication System
- **Login Page** (`index.html`): Validates user credentials
- **Registration Page** (`register.html`): Creates new user accounts
- **Password Recovery** (`recovery.html`): Handles forgotten passwords
- **Session Management**: Maintains user state across page navigation

### 2. Dashboard System
- **Main Dashboard** (`dashboard.html`): Central hub for all banking operations
- **Navigation**: Sidebar menu with different banking sections
- **Account Summary**: Displays account balance and basic information
- **Transaction History**: Shows last 10 transactions

### 3. Transaction Management
- **Deposit Module**: Electronic deposits with reference generation
- **Withdrawal Module**: Cash withdrawals with balance validation
- **Bill Payment Module**: Utility bill payments (electricity, gas, water, internet)
- **Transaction Recording**: Automatic transaction logging with timestamps

### 4. User Interface Components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimization
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for all input forms
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and feedback
- **Visual Design**: Modern banking interface with professional styling

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration**:
   - User fills registration form → Data validation → Account number generation → Store in localStorage → Redirect to login

2. **Authentication**:
   - User enters credentials → Validate against localStorage → Set session → Redirect to dashboard

3. **Transaction Processing**:
   - User initiates transaction → Validate account balance → Process transaction → Update balance → Record transaction → Show confirmation

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - All data changes are immediately saved to localStorage
   - No server-side synchronization required

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for modern typography
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements
- **No JavaScript frameworks**: Pure vanilla JavaScript implementation

### Browser APIs
- **localStorage**: For data persistence
- **DOM APIs**: For dynamic content manipulation
- **Form APIs**: For form validation and submission

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Implementation
- **Static Files**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files can be served from any web server
- **No Build Process**: Direct deployment without compilation
- **Client-Side Only**: No server-side requirements

### Considerations for Production
- **Data Storage**: Currently uses localStorage - will need database integration for production
- **Security**: Client-side validation only - requires server-side validation for production
- **Authentication**: Simulated authentication - requires proper authentication system
- **State Management**: Local state only - may need centralized state management for complex features

### Scalability Notes
- The application is designed as a proof-of-concept using browser storage
- For production deployment, backend integration would be required
- The modular JavaScript architecture allows for easy migration to server-side APIs
- The HTML structure supports progressive enhancement for additional features
